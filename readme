Works with HiveOS with nvidia-info

Returns as a dannger message in hiveOS if any cards are working in 1x or 4x speed. Also sends a file to the interface containing which ones are running at that speed.

If all cards are at 8x will send a simple info message.




Instructions to pull and run file:

cd /tmp/ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luis15pt/Nexgen/main/linkspeed.sh && chmod +x linkspeed.sh && ./linkspeed.sh
